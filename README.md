# Autorun
Simple, Small script that I autorun for gmod.

Features:
Basic lua dumping (hooked loadbuffer, loadbufferx, loadstring), doesn't support folders / separate servers right now and kind of writes to your gmod folder.
Separate game console that allows for running commands (currently only lua_run)
